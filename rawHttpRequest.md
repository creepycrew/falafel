# Raw HTTP Request
The Raw HTTP Request functionality provides (REST) connectors a way to expose a more generic/raw operation in order to perform direct API requests, generally with a basis on the connector's global configuration. This means that more raw API requests can be executed with some service/connector specific pre-processing and formatting, such as setting authentication, without having to resort to the HTTP client and manually configure the entire request.
